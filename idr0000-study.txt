Study Description	A data-driven analysis of cell morphology and intracellular organization in the developing zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium, a model tissue for the study of self-organized morphogenesis. 3D image stacks were acquired using AiryScan FAST-mode confocal fluorescence microscopy. Automated single-cell segmentation and point cloud-based morphometry were used to extract numerical features representing cell morphology and intracellular protein distributions. Machine learning was used on the extracted numerical features to perform data integration across experiments and context-guided data visualization. The resulting data was analyzed to discover biologically meaningful patterns at the cell and tissue scale.

Protocol Description	Zebrafish embryos were grown in E3 buffer at 27-30Â°C according to standard procedures (see zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/zfbk.html). Pigmentation was prevented by treating embryos with 0.002% N-phenylthiourea (PTU) starting at 25hpf. For imaging, embryos were dechorionated manually, anaesthetized with 0.01% Tricaine and mounted in 1% peqGOLD Low Melt Agarose in E3 containing 0.01% Tricaine in a MatTek Glass Bottom Microwell Dish (35mm Petri dish, 10mm microwell, 0.16-0.19mm coverglass).	Embryos carried the transgenic membrane label cldnb:lyn-EGFPR (see doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2006.02.019). Imaging was performed on the Zeiss LSM880 AiryScan confocal microscope in FAST mode with a 40X 1.2NA water objective with Immersol W immersion fluid. Deconvolution was performed using the ZEN Black Software's 3D AiryScan deconvolution with 'auto' settings. Single-cell segmentation, feature extraction and point cloud-based morphometry for feature embedding were performed using custom python pipelines and algorithms, described in detail in the study publication.	Numerical features describing protein distributions, smFISH RNA spot counts and manually annotated cell archetypes were predicted for each cell using machine learning based on cell shape features as input, as described in the study publication.
